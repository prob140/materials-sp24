    "\n",
    "From a practical perspective, the true value $\\mu$ comes from the quantity being measured (for example, the true weight of an object). The error terms come from the measuring process (for example, from the balance being used for weighing). Thus $\\sigma$ is sometimes known because of extensive experience with the measuring process (for example, having used the same balance to weigh many different objects). \n",
